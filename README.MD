# HOW TO SETUP
1. press the windows button and type 'powershell' press enter and type 'python' hit enter and install
2. from the command line run this command 'pip install requests pandas PySimpleGUI lxml'
3. download the git repo (https://github.com/blimpus/ff) (press the green code button to download the zip file and extract it) into a folder on your computer (my personal favorite is the desktop) 
4. if you extracted to your desktop you can go to C:\Users\Austin\Desktop\ff-main\ff-main\ffscraper.py
5. you could alternatively replace your python run command to just pass the global file location explained below

# HOW TO RUN FROM GLOBAL LOCATION
1. open powershell by pressing the windows key and typing 'powershell' then pressing enter
2. if you installed it into a different folder than your desktop then you are on your own
3. run this command 'python3 C:\Users\Austin\Desktop\ff\ffscraper.py'
